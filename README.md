# AREC 596: Getting Started with Github Desktop
This repo is a tutorial for teaching students in AREC 596 how to use Github Desktop. It borrows instructions from the [Github Docs page on how to use Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop).

## Part 1: Installing GitHub Desktop and authenticating your account
You all should have done this before class. But if not, you can install GitHub Desktop on any supported operating system. After you install the app, you will need to sign in and authenticate your account on GitHub or GitHub Enterprise before you can create and clone a tutorial repository.

For more information on installing and authenticating, see "[Setting up GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/setting-up-github-desktop)."
